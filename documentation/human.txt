Human model

Eventually this will get very complex.

At first I think just a simple model:

Person:
- Age
- Name
- Sex
- Task

PersonGenerator:
- Randomly rolls people based on tables for above (M/F, M/F firstname, lastname, age)

Person interaction with task:
- Humans assigned a task (or choose one)
- Humans use time working on a task
- Humans make progress on task (depending on time, also skill, difficulty, tools, environment etc)
- Humans complete task
- Humans abandon task

Task model:
- Tasks have a category 
- Task may have outcomes (complete research, build module, prevent navigational error etc)
- Task has side effects (consume resources, incur wear on module or tools)
- Task has back effects on human (fatigue, boredom, injury, recovery)
- Tasks very broad. May be work (e.g. build module), or may be personal (sleep, socialise)

Draw distinction between task and work order:
- Task: Belongs to person. Whatever person is doing right now based on dynamic determination of 
priorities. Always exactly one task (including idle task)
- Work order: Request from base module (or other generators? Mostly these I think) for item of work
to be completed. Base keeps a queue (per module or global?)
- Person will be assigned to work order based on priority and will generate an associated task.
- Work orders will require 0 or more workers:
  - some passive - e.g. solar panels produce electricity without intervention.
  - some one person - e.g. pilot vehicle
  - some many people - e.g. work in workshop
- Some tasks passive. e.g. consume oxygen 
    - actually I think maybe this is best handle by back effects? all tasks will have back effect
      to consume oxygen. Some may have a strenuous modifier to increase it, or person has stressed
      modifier, or environmental factors affect consumption rate - point is, I think determination
      of this belongs with person when evaluating back effects of task.
- Work orders can be parallel. E.g. large factory producing multiple production runs
- Work orders can be automated (i.e. no workers). E.g. automated production line (c.f. solar panel example)

Example tasks:
- eat 
- sleep
- leisure
- socialise
- travel
- pilot ship
- pilot vehicle
- work on construction
- maintain module
- do research
- survey area

Example work orders:
- mine minerals
- assemble rocket
- research topic
- grow food (passive)
- tend food (active)
- maintain module
