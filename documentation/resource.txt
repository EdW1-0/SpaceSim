Did this before with ResourceSim.
I think workable.

Basically we have:
- Resource class 
- Each instance has:
- name
- id
- properties:
- countable
- base values
- mass 
- volatile
- propellant
- edible
- structural
- shielding
- vacuum tolerant
- etc

Then we have 
- Reaction class
- Encodes a reaction to convert between Resources 
- Has inputs
- Has outputs
- Rate 
- Efficiency
- Cost (energy?)

Do we make some resources special? (energy? money? research?)
Do we do reaction class for endpoints? (e.g extract ore from ground?)
Buildings then implement reactions 
May make sense to make an inheritance tree for resources if some classes have special behaviour (e.g. propellants need to know
specific impulse, but nothing else does. Construction materials need to know strength etc)
