Design notes for tech tree subcomponent.

Attempt at specification:

 This system stores a directed graph of technologies. 
 It needs to store progress in unlocking these technologies.
 It needs to allow multiple clients to track their progress independently.
 It needs to load the tech nodes from an object store with the correct connections
 It needs to load the progress also.
 It needs to allow targets to be selected for research
 It needs to allow research to be applied to that target.
 It needs to track when the research is done.
 It needs to allow unlocked technologies to implement side effects
    The side effects are essentially unrestricted. Best would be to allow extensibility and hooking of arbitrary side effects.
 It needs to allow querying:
   - Pull entire tree (or subsections) for visualisation
   - Pull current target
   - Pull potential targets
   - Pull completed technologies

Optional:
May want to support tech families (biotech, physics etc)
May want to support invisible techs 
May want to support complex tech completion (i.e. not just rack up research points, requires milestones to be completed)


Things to decide:

- Instantiation 
  - One global tree?
  - One per agency? 
  - Global tree but agencies track own progress?
- Node interface
- Progress tracking 
  - In node?
  - Top level?
- Side effects
  - Abstract node with subclasses implementing?
  - Mixins?
  - Pluggable interface?
  - Tech effect class?
